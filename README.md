# Markov Decision Process - Q Learning  

Objective: Using the AI_gym environment [link](https://gym.openai.com/) design an algorithm which will instruct an agent to learn and succeed at different tasks.    

What is Q-learning?  
From Wikipedia: Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. It does not require a model of the environment (hence "model-free"), and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations. 

For any finite Markov decision process (FMDP), Q-learning finds an optimal policy in the sense of maximizing the expected value of the total reward over any and all successive steps, starting from the current state.  Q-learning can identify an optimal action-selection policy for any given FMDP, given infinite exploration time and a partly-random policy. "Q" refers to the function that the algorithm computes â€“ the expected rewards for an action taken in a given state. [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning)
